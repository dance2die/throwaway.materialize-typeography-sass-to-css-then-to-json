# What is this?

I am trying to automate conversion of [Materilize CSS](https://materializecss.com/) SASS to CSS, then to CSS.

Not worth it. Better to just use the materilize.css directly from [the source](https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/blob/v1-dev/dist/css/materialize.css).

The output JS is to be used for Tailwind CSS preset to provide styling for Materl UI within TW.
